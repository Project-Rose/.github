# Project Rosé

Project Rosé is a Nintendo revival service that aims to recreate Nintendo TVii on your Wii U! (Japan Version)

# FAQ

> What was Nintendo TVii?

Nintendo TVii was a TV guide that allowed you to see what programs were airing at the time as well watch as movies and shows available on streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video (Which Project Rosé will not be reviving as it would be piracy as TVii would redirect to the app to use that service thats installed on your Wii U).

> Is Project Rosé piracy?

No, Project Rosé uses free public APIs and streams no content besides trailers taken from The Movie DB API.

> Can I test this project?

Maybe! Join our Discord server for development updates or ask to be a tester! https://discord.gg/EZ2dukdynU

> Will this revival be 1:1?

Unfortunately no. Our revival uses all free and Public APIs such as [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and [TV Guide](https://www.tvguide.com/) so it will be much more limited than the original Nintendo TVii.

> Are you affilated with Pretendo in anyway?

No. Pretendo Network has nothing to do with us.

> Will the US TVii UI be revived?

We don't know for right now. As we tried but we bit off more than we could chew. As such, we have switched to reviving Japan TVii, this one will be difficult in it's own way as we are trying to find as much information as we can about it!
