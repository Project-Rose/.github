Project Rosè is a Nintendo revival service that aims to recreate Nintendo TVii on your Wii U!

# FAQ

> What was Nintendo TVii?

Nintendo TVii was a TV guide that allowed you to see what programs were airing at the time as well as movies and tv available on streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video (Which Project Rosè will not be reviving as it would be piracy)

> Is Project Rosè piracy?

No, Project Rosè uses free public APIs and streams no content besides trailers taken from The Movie DB API.

> Can I test this project?

Maybe! Join our Discord server for development updates or ask to be a tester! https://discord.gg/EZ2dukdynU

> Will this revival be 1:1

Unfortunately no. Our revival uses all free and Public APIs such as [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and [Zap2It](https://tvlistings.zap2it.com/) so it will be much more limited than the original Nintendo TVii.

> Are you affilated with Pretendo in anyway?

No. Pretendo Network has nothing to do with us however we plan to use their 3rd party service to authenticate our accounts in our revival!

> Will the Japanese TVii UI be revived

Maybe. This is still in consideration and we don't know if its feasible to manage two Nintendo TVii revivals
